# EOF_Analysis_SCN
These scripts are written for matlab (R2018a). They include

  EOF.m : Empirical orthogonal function analysis of SCN slice data.
  
  myChiSquarePeriodogram.m : Period analysis by Chi-square periodogram.
  
  Cosinor4.m : Cosinor fitting to compute acrophase.
  
  myTrendPol2.m : Detrending of time trace.

Running these codes will reproduce the results in the publication : Tokuda, I.T., Ono, D., Honma, S., Honma, K.-I., & Herzel, H. (2018). Coherency of circadian rhythms in the SCN is governed by the interplay of two coupling factors. PLoS Computational Biology.
